Save Installation and Configuration
===================================

1. Prerequisites

    o Mon >= 1.2

    o Iproute2 (ip command)

    o ndsend utility
        o only needed for IPv6 failover support
        o found in vzctl-core package of OpenVZ project (openvz.org)

    o Perl >= 5.7.3 and non-standard modules:
        o Digest::HMAC_MD5
        o Mail::Sendmail
        o Mon::Client
        o Net::ARP
        o Net::Arping
        o XML::Simple


2. Installation

    First install Mon and Iproute2 per their documentation.  Next,
    copy the Save executable to a directory used for storing
    executables.  For example:

        cp perl/save /usr/local/bin

    would install the executable to /usr/local/bin.  Finally, copy the
    Save alerts and monitors to the Mon alert and monitor directories,
    respectively.  For example:

        cp perl/alerts/* /usr/local/lib/mon/alert.d
        cp perl/monitors/* /usr/local/lib/mon/mon.d

    would install the Save alerts/monitors into the default
    alert/monitor locations of a Mon installation in /usr/local.


3. Configuration

    3.1. Save configuration

        3.1.1. /etc/saverc

            This file contains an XML description of the various
            configuration parameters utilized by Save.  A skeleton for
            this file can be copied from "etc/saverc" and a full
            description of its contents is given in "doc/saverc.txt".
            
            Note that this file should be world-readable to allow
            actions such as synchronization for multiple users.

    3.2. Mon configuration

        3.2.1 /etc/mon/mon.cf

            See the Mon documentation for a full description of this
            file.  A sample configuration file can be found in
            "etc/mon.cf" and Save-specific alerts and monitors are
            described in "doc/alerts.txt" and "doc/monitors.txt",
            respectively.

        3.2.2 /etc/mon/auth.cf (Mon trap heartbeats only)

            For Mon trap heartbeats to work properly, all peer systems
            must be authorized to send Mon traps to each other.  For
            example:

                trap section
                    host2 * *
                    host2-priv * *

            would authorize host2 and its private interface host2-priv
            to send traps to the local system.  Note that Mon traps do
            not work properly with IPv6-only peer addresses so ssh
            heartbeats should be used in that case.

    3.3. Firewall configuration

        Mon uses UDP port 2583 by default for traps, which are used for
        Save's heartbeat functionality.  This port must be allowed
        through both the network between peers and the local firewall.

        3.3.1. /etc/iptables.conf

            For iptables, this can be done by adding the appropriate
            rules to the INPUT chain:

                -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.2/32 -p udp -m udp --dport 2583 -j ACCEPT
                -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 2583 -j DROP
                -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2583 -j DROP

            This assumes there is one peer host with address 192.168.1.2
            and that the OUTPUT chain already allows outbound traffic
            on this port.

    3.4. Sysctl configuration (IPv6 only)

        3.4.1. /etc/sysctl.conf

            For IPv6 failover to work correctly, the following sysctl
            settings must be set to 0:

                net.ipv6.conf.X.dad_transmits
                net.ipv6.conf.X.accept_dad

            where X is the network interface associated with the IPv6
            failover address (equal to the value of the "device6"
            element in /etc/saverc).  For example, for a "device6"
            setting of eth0, the following sysctl settings would be
            required:

                net.ipv6.conf.eth0.dad_transmits = 0
                net.ipv6.conf.eth0.accept_dad = 0

    3.5. SSH configuration

        3.5.1. /etc/ssh/ssh_config

            If the files of a large number of non-root users need to
            be synchronized by users themselves (whether explicitly
            or implicitly embedded within other programs), it is
            recommended that host-based authentication be enabled
            between peer nodes.  This is done using appropriate SSH
            client configuration.  For example:

                EnableSSHKeysign yes
                Host host2.example.com host2
                    HostbasedAuthentication yes

            would allow the current host to use host-based authentication
            when connecting to host2.example.com.  Note that appropriate
            configuration on the server-side is also required as discussed
            below.

            The alternative in this case is to define private SSH keys
            for all users (see "doc/saverc.txt").

        3.5.2. /etc/ssh/sshd_config

            To allow other peers to connect via host-based
            authentication, it must be enabled within the SSH server:

                HostbasedAuthentication yes

            To synchronize root-owned files or to execute commands as
            root across peers, it is necessary to allow some form of
            root login.  The recommended form is to only allow forced
            commands:

                PermitRootLogin forced-commands-only

            See "man sshd_config" for other possible values.

        3.5.3. /etc/ssh/shosts.equiv

            The final piece of configuration needed to support
            host-based authentication is to add peers to the list of
            trusted remote hosts.  For example:

                host2.example.com

            would allow host2.example.com to authenticate via host-based
            authentication.

        3.5.4. /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

            If root-level operations are required with forced command
            root logins, an appropriate command must be added to the
            entry in root's authorized_keys file that corresponds to the
            key specified for the root user in the Save configuration
            file (see "doc/saverc.txt").  This can be done using the
            --shift option (see "doc/usage.txt"):

                from="host2.example.com",command="/usr/local/bin/save \
                    --shift $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" ssh-rsa ...

            Note that the line join (\) is for readability only and
            should not be used in real key files.  This command would
            allow root logins from host2.example.com and allow Save to
            be executed with the first argument (which will be the
            invocation of Save in the normal case) shifted off.

            If synchronized commands are not required, it is recommended
            to add an additional --shift and the --file option, which
            disables command processing:

                from="host2.example.com",command="/usr/local/bin/save \
                    --file --shift --shift $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" ssh-rsa ...

            This prevents arbitrary commands from being executed with
            this key.


4. Activation

    Save is automatically activated within Mon.  Mon is typically
    activated using:
    
        /etc/init.d/mon start

    To ensure Mon is always running, it can be added to a root crontab.
    For example:

        */2 * * * * /usr/bin/env PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin /etc/init.d/mon start >/dev/null 2>&1

    would execute Mon every two minutes.  This is a noop if Mon is
    already running.
